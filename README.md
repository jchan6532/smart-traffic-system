# Smart Traffic System Simulation

## Description
Smart Traffic System Simulation is a dynamic and interactive project designed to simulate traffic patterns using HTML Canvas and JavaScript. This project aims to provide insights into traffic flow, signal timing, and congestion management in an urban setting.

## Features
- Real-time traffic simulation on HTML Canvas.
- Interactive controls to alter traffic flow and signal timings.
- Visualization of different traffic scenarios including peak hours, accidents, and road closures.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Uses neural networks to pilot the self-driving cars

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Installing
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the simulation.

## Usage
- Use the control panel to change traffic parameters.
- Observe how different settings affect traffic flow and congestion.
- Utilize the simulation for educational or research purposes.

## Built With
- HTML5 Canvas - For rendering the simulation.
- JavaScript - For creating interactive features and simulation logic.
